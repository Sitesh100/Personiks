        'Gastric Sleeve Surgery, also known as Sleeve Gastrectomy, is a weight-loss procedure that involves removing approximately 75-80% of the stomach, leaving a narrow, sleeve-shaped stomach about the size and shape of a banana. This significantly reduces the amount of food you can eat and helps you feel full sooner.',

        'Gastric Sleeve Surgery aids in weight loss by limiting the amount of food you can consume and reducing the production of the hunger hormone ghrelin, which decreases appetite. The smaller stomach size promotes a feeling of fullness with less food, leading to reduced calorie intake and weight loss.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Who is a good candidate for Gastric Sleeve Surgery?',
